# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. We've developed a model that takes various features of a car as input and predicts its price. The model is deployed as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.


## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Machine Learning model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- XGBoost Regressor as the final model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- XGBoost for the final regression model
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Streamlit for web application development

## Setup and Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
```
Install the required packages:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
## Usage

- Open the Streamlit app in your web browser.
- Input the car's features (e.g., brand, model, year, mileage).
- Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated price.

## Model Performance
- RMSE: 434,041.70
- R-squared: 0.9369

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more recent data
- Experiment with ensemble methods
- Add feature importance analysis to the web app
